This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a video summarization application designed to be user-friendly for non-technical users. The main goal is to create an easy-to-use app that summarizes videos and allows users to ask questions about the video content.

**Key Priorities:**
- Ease of use (target users are not familiar with coding/command line)
- Ease of setup
- Accuracy of summaries

**Primary Use Case:** Summarizing long informational videos

## Current Status

This project is in its initial planning phase. The repository currently contains only the project description document (`project_description.md`) which outlines the goals and requirements.

## Development Notes

Since this is a new project with no existing code structure, future development should focus on:

1. **Technology Stack Selection**: Choose technologies that align with the ease-of-use priority (likely web-based or desktop GUI)
2. **User Interface**: Design should be intuitive for non-technical users
3. **Video Processing**: Will need to implement video transcription and AI-powered summarization
4. **Question Answering**: Interactive Q&A functionality about video content

When implementing this project, consider the target audience and prioritize simplicity in both setup and usage over advanced technical features.
